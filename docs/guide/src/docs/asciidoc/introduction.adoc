= Introduction

This project provides a set of Gradle plugins that follow an opinionated way to build Java, Groovy, Scala or Kotlin projects.
The conventions defined by these plugins closely follow common practices observed in many Open Source projects.

== Rationale

The Gradle Build Tool is very flexible and extensible, allowing developers to micro-manage every single aspect
of a particular build. However, with great power comes great responsibility and in this case higher maintenance as at
some point, many Gradle builds turn out to be custom builds, that is, each one follows their own conventions and/or
are written with a slightly different style, making it difficult to understand the pattern and apply the conventions
to another build.

In contrast, the Apache Maven build tool follows a much stricter yet still somehow flexible path to define builds.
Many developers have cited Maven's "strictness" or "inflexibility" as a feature rather than a limitation of the tool.
Personally I prefer a highly flexible tool (such as Gradle) while at the same time applying a structure on top that can
still be bent to a certain degree. The plugins found in this project provide such a structure.

The following sections describe the conventions and each of the plugins.

NOTE: In this guide you'll see examples that run Gradle using the `gm` command. This command is provided by
link:https://github.com/kordamp/gm[Gum], it let's you run a build with either the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) or the
Gradle command (`gradle`). If you're unsure of the command to invoke then just use the wrapper or gradle directly.
